# Portals

## Overview

CalCOFI data is available through various portals, each serving different purposes and user needs. This document outlines the main access points and their characteristics.

## Data Flow

While it would be ideal for CalCOFI data to be available through a single portal, each portal has its strengths and limitations. The following diagram illustrates one possible realization of data flow between CalCOFI data and the portals: from raw data to the integrated database to portals and meta-portals.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-portals-flow
%%| fig-cap: "Flow of data from raw to database to portals and meta-portals."
%%| file: diagrams/portals_flow.mmd
%%| fig-width: 6
```

In practice, CalCOFI is a partnership with various contributing members, so the authoritative dataset might flow differently, such as from EDI to the database to the other portals. The other portals, such as OBIS or ERDDAP, serve different audiences or purposes. The meta-portals like ODIS and Data.gov then index these portals to provide broader discovery of CalCOFI datasets.

## Portals

While some portals serve as data repositories, others provide advanced data access and visualization tools. The following sections describe the main portals where CalCOFI data is available and their key features.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-portals
#| tbl-cap: Portal Capabilities.

librarian::shelf(
  dplyr, gt, here, readr, scales)

portals_csv <- here("data/portal_comparison.csv")

# Define the capability symbols and colors
cap_symbols <- c(
  "none"    = "✖",  # "\u2716",   # ✖
  "partial" = "▲",  # "\u25B2",   # ▲
  "full"    = "✔")  # "\u2714")   # ✔
cap_colors <- c(
  "none"    = "#FFCCCC",  # Light red
  "partial" = "#FFF2CC",  # Light yellow
  "full"    = "#CCFFCC")  # Light green

# Create the gt table
read_csv(portals_csv, show_col_types = F) |>
  gt(rowname_col = "Portal") |> 
  # Apply background colors based on capability levels
  data_color(
    # columns = everything(),
    fn      = scales::col_factor(
      palette = as.character(cap_colors),
      levels  = names(cap_colors))) |> 
  # Center align the text
  cols_align(
    align = "center",
    columns = everything() ) |>
  # Apply colored symbols
  text_transform(
    fn = function(x) {
      cap_symbols[x] } ) |>
  # Add a caption explaining the symbols and colors
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = md(
      "**Capability Legend**: ✔ = full, ▲ = partial, ✖ = none")) |>
  # Adjust the table's style for better aesthetics
  tab_options(
    table.width      = pct(100),
    data_row.padding = px(5))
```

## Metadata

The [Ecological Metadata Language (EML)](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/) (and using R package [EML](https://docs.ropensci.org/EML/) in workflows) serves as a key standard for describing ecological and environmental data. For CalCOFI, EML metadata files are generated alongside data files, providing structured documentation that enables interoperability across different data portals. This metadata-driven approach allows automated ingestion into various data systems while maintaining data integrity and provenance.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-portals-metadata
%%| fig-cap: "Metadata in the form of ecological metadata language (EML) is used to describe the dataset in a consistent manner that can be ingested by the portals."
%%| file: diagrams/portals_metadata.mmd
%%| fig-width: 6
```

The EML specification provides detailed structure for describing datasets, including:

-   Dataset identification and citation
-   Geographic and temporal coverage
-   Variable definitions and units
-   Methods and protocols
-   Quality control procedures
-   Access and usage rights

This standardized metadata enables automated data transformation and ingestion into various portal systems while preserving the original data context and quality information.

## Meta-Portals

### Google Dataset Search

The JSON-LD metadata in the Portal dataset web pages get indexed by [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?query=calcofi) through schema.org metadata. This ensures that CalCOFI data is discoverable through Google search and other search engines.

### ODIS
**Ocean Data Information System**

ODIS uses the same technology as Google Dataset Search (schema.org, JSON-LD), but focuses on ocean data. CalCOFI curates a sitemap of authoritative datasets to server to [ODIS.org](https://odis.org)

This federated approach ensures that CalCOFI data remains:

-   Discoverable through multiple channels
-   Properly cited and attributed
-   Integrated with global ocean data systems
